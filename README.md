# Path-Planning-Least-polluted-routes

This is my MSc Dissertation: Least polluted routes.

## AIM
This project aims to develop a mobile application which can help people find cleanest routes between places.

# Client-Server
I developed an Android application which is client and deployed the server in cloud.

As a client, the application needs to send the request to the server every time when it wants to plan routes.

On server side, I use Spring Boot to deploy Restful API to deal with requests from client.
